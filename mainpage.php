                <p class="text-justify">INDIANAPOLIS — The Indianapolis Colts today officially began on-field preparations for Thursday night's Week 10 contest against the Tennessee Titans. What were some of the top takeaways on the day?
                                        Injury report
                                        Here is today's injury report, the first of the week for the Colts:
                                        'Very unlikely' Doyle plays Thursday
                                        Colts head coach Frank Reich said today that tight end Jack Doyle is in the league's concussion protocol, and with the quick turnaround this week it's "probably going to be tough for him to get cleared" by Thursday night's game against the Titans.
                                        "We'll take it day by day," Reich said. "But probably not counting on him for this Thursday. It'd be very unlikely that he would clear by then."
                                        Doyle suffered the concussion just before halftime of Sunday's Week 9 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, when he was attempting to make a catch on a Philip Rivers throw across the middle and took on a shoulder-to-helmet hit from safety DeShon Elliott, who was not flagged on the play.
                                        The two-time Pro Bowl tight end Doyle also missed the Colts' Week 2 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings with knee and ankle injuries. He has nine receptions for 108 yards and two touchdowns on the year.
                                        If Doyle is unable to play Thursday night in Tennessee, then the team will continue to turn to veterans Trey Burton and Mo Alie-Cox at the tight end position, while undrafted rookie Noah Togiai could be called up to play in his fourth game of the year.</p>
